# sorting_algorithms
how to install:
1. either download the releases or the folders.
2. if you downloaded the folders theres an executable in the subfolders
3. Most of these executables are only compiled for Windows x86-64, if your platform ist different you need to download Lazarus IDE and compile them for yourself
4. If you want to use the cli programs on Linux then go figure it out yourself, I don't know how that works. If  you're on Windows then copy the .exe into c:/windows/system32/

these algorithms either expect numbers split by hashtags or files wtih such content as input.
